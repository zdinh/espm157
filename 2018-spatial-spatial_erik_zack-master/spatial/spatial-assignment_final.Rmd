```

We will map potential areas of marine aquaculture for the super cute Pacific spiny lumpsucker (*Eumicrotremus orbis*)

![They have adhesive pelvic disks! How cute!](./images/lumpsucker.png)

To do this we are going to need the following spatial data:  

**1. Sea Surface Temperature** (raster data)  
**2. Net Primary Productivity** (raster data)  
**3. Marine Protected Areas**  (vector data)  

```{r libraries, include= FALSE}
#install.packages(c("mapview", "raster", "sf"))
library(mapview)      #interactive maps, raster + vector layers
library(raster)       #Main raster library
library(tidyverse)    #our old friend
library(sf)           #to work with simple features data
#library(rgdal)
```  

Key information for optimal growth:  

- Sea surface temperatures between **12 and 18 degrees Celsius**  
- Net Primary Productivity between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**

```{r}
#load west coast marine protected areas shapefile 
mpas <- st_read("shapefiles/mpas_westcoast.shp", quiet = TRUE)

#load sea surface temperature
rasterstack <-stack(list.files("rasters/", pattern = "average", full.names = TRUE))
rasterstack <- stack(files)

#load net primary productivity
npp <- raster("rasters/annual_npp.tif")
```

### Map of West Coast Marine Protected Areas

```{r}
#plot west coast marine protected areas shapefile
plot(mpas["State"], main = "West Coast MPAs by State", pal = sf.colors(10, categorical = TRUE), border = 'white', 
     axes = FALSE, key.pos = 4, key.width = lcm(10), graticule = TRUE)

#ggplot method
#mpas %>% ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(col = State))
```
### MPAs
The National Marine Fisheries Service contorls the largest amount of marine habitat (387,058.3 square kilometers). The table below, in descening order states total area for each entity.

```{r}
mpas %>%
    select(State, Area_KM_To) %>%
    group_by(State) %>%
    summarise(TotalArea = sum(Area_KM_To)) %>%
    arrange(desc(TotalArea)) 
```


## Sea Surface Temperature

```{r sst}
plot(rasterstack)
```


### Task 2: Visualize & Explore

```{r}
summary(rasterstack)
```
#### Question: What year had the highest annual sea surface temperature recorded?

The highest annual sea surface temperature was in 2011 with a max of 307.2733 K.


```{r}
converter <- function(rasterdata) {
  calc(rasterdata, fun = mean) - 273.15
}

combined_sst <- converter(rasterstack)

plot(combined_sst, main = "Combined Sea Surface Temperature (2008-2012)")
```


## Net Primary Production

```{r}
npp <- raster("rasters/annual_npp.tif")
plot(npp, main = "Net Primary Produciton")
```

### Reproject

```{r}
crs(combined_sst)
```

```{r}
crs(npp)
```
```{r}
st_crs(mpas)
```

```{r}
sst_prj <- projectRaster(combined_sst, crs = crs(npp), asText = TRUE)

identicalCRS(sst_prj, npp)
```

```{r}
summary(values(sst_prj))

all.equal(sst_prj, npp)

Stack_SST_NPP <- stack(sst_prj, npp)
plot(Stack_SST_NPP)
```

#### Question: Looking at them side by side, do you have intuition about where lumpsuckers are likely to survive? 
Remember: Lumpsucker fish grow best in waters that are 
**between 12 and 18 degrees Celsius.** and with an NPP between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**

## Exercise 4:  Analysis   

### Sample Points & Extract values from Rasters

```{r}
mpas_sample <- mpas %>%
  st_sample(1000) %>%
  st_sf() %>%
  st_join(mpas)

#mpas_sample
#plot(mpas_sample)
```

#### R Question: Why does your new dataframe of points likely have fewer than 1000 points? 

The new dataframe has less than a 1000 points because sample points intersecting more than one polygon are utilized more than once, there for resulting in few total points.

### Task 2: Extract Raster Values
Use your sampled points to extract information from the rasters 
on sea surface temperature and net primary productivity, 
try using the `raster::extract` function. Remember `mutate` plays nicely
with `sf` objects. 

```{r}
extracted_temp_npp <- Stack_SST_NPP %>%
  raster::extract(mpas_sample) %>%
  as.data.frame()

sample_temp_npp <- mpas_sample %>%
  mutate(temp = extracted_temp_npp$layer, annual_npp = extracted_temp_npp$annual_npp)%>%
  select(geometry, temp, annual_npp)

sample_temp_npp
```

### Task 3: Analysis Questions
For the following questions, remember that Lumpsucker fish grow best in waters that are 
**between 12 and 18 degrees Celsius.** and with an NPP between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**

#### Question 1: At what percentage of your sampled points would lumpsucker fish be found?
```{r}
623/974

```
Lumpsucker fish would be found at around 64% of our sampled points, although this percentage could change since R doesn't always produce the same amount of sample points.

```{r}
suitable <- sample_temp_npp %>%
  filter(temp >=12 & temp <= 18)%>%
  filter(annual_npp >=2.6 & annual_npp <= 3)

unsuitable <- sample_temp_npp %>%
  filter(temp < 12 & temp > 18) %>% 
  filter(annual_npp < 2.6 & annual_npp > 3) 

unsuitable
```

#### Question 2: In your set of sampled points, what is the minimum latitude where lumpsucker fish are likely to be found?
```{r}
st_bbox(suitable)
lumpbox <- st_make_grid(suitable, n = 1)
lumpbox

lumpSuckerData2 <- st_transform(suitable, crs = "+proj=longlat")
lumpSuckerData2
```
The minuimum latitude is 31.06 degrees North.

#### Question 3: Plot only those points where lumpsucker fish are found. 
Green areas are suitable for the lump sucker while red areas are not based on SST and NPP thresholds.
```{r}

plot(Stack_SST_NPP[[1]],  main = "Suitabile Habitat for the Pacific Spiny Lumpsucker on the West Coast")
plot(lumpbox, add = TRUE)
plot(suitable, col = "green", add = TRUE)
plot(unsuitable, col = "red", add = TRUE)

```
