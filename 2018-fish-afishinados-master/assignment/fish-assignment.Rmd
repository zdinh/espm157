## The Database

We used data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](http://ramlegacy.marinebiodiversity.ca/ram-legacy-stock-assessment-database)

First, we loaded in the necessary librarys. 
```{r message = FALSE}
#load libraries
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
```

## Reading in the tables

```{r}
## old link not working today:
#download.file("https://depts.washington.edu/ramlegac/wordpress/databaseVersions/RLSADB_v3.0_(assessment_data_only)_excel.zip", 

# backup copy for class:
download.file("https://github.com/espm-157/fish-template/releases/download/data/ramlegacy.zip", 
              "ramlegacy.zip")
path <- unzip("ramlegacy.zip")  #unzip the .xls files
sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(path) #use the readxl package to identify sheet names 
ram <- lapply(sheets, readxl::read_excel, path = path)  #read the data from all 3 sheets into a list
names(ram) <- sheets # give the list of datatables their assigned sheet names
```

```{r}
## check your names
names(ram)
```

```{r}
#check your data, from ram file, taxomony tab, myersname column, filter for "COD"
ram$taxonomy %>% 
  filter(myersname == "COD")
```

```{r}
#ram file, timeseries tab
ram$timeseries
```

```{r}
#ram file, stock tab
ram$stock
```

```{r}
#filter stock by tsn number
ram$stock %>% 
  filter(tsn == 164712)
```

```{r}
#cod_tsn = extract first tsn number for genus "Gadus"
cod_tsn <-
  ram$taxonomy %>% 
  filter(genus == "Gadus") %>%
  pull(tsn)
cod_tsn[1]
```


```{r}
#filter stock by tsn number
ram$stock %>% 
  filter(tsn %in% cod_tsn)
```

```{r}
#for tsn join ram$area to ram$stock
ram$taxonomy %>%
  filter(genus == "Gadus") %>%
  select(tsn) %>%
  left_join(ram$stock) %>%
  left_join(ram$area)
```

```{r}
ram$stock %>% 
  group_by(tsn) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
#172419
```

```{r}
cod <- ram$taxonomy %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = "tsn") %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid") %>%
  left_join(ram$timeseries, by = "stockid") %>% 
  left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c("tsid" = "tsunique")) %>%
  
  group_by(tsid) %>%
  
  filter(genus == "Gadus", species == "morhua") %>%
  filter(tscategory == "CATCH or LANDINGS") %>%
  filter(tsunitsshort == "MT") %>%

  arrange(desc(tsyear)) 
  #select(tsn)
  #select(tsyear, tsvalue, country, region, commonname, stockid, tsn, areaid)
cod
```

#  Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

First, We seek to replicate the following figure from the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data. 

![](https://github.com/espm-157/website/raw/master/static/img/cod.jpg)

Cod by area:

```{r}
cod %>%
    select(areaname, areacode, areaid, region, country) %>%
  distinct() 
```

Mapping the data from just the areas where Atlantic Cod are found:

```{r}
cod %>%
  select(areaname, areacode, areaid, region, country) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(country == c("Canada", "USA", "Mexico"))
```

## Subsetting our data by regional id

Vector of ids in Canada:


```{r}
cod %>%
  select(areaname, areacode, areaid, region, country) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(country == "Canada")
```

#Total catch of cod
```{r}
cod %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>% 
  summarise(catch_tons = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tsyear, catch_tons)) + geom_line() + labs( x = "Year", y = "Catch (MT)")
```

##Total Catch in Canada

```{r}
cod %>%
  filter(country == "Canada") %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>% 
  summarise(catch_tons = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(tsyear, catch_tons)) + geom_line() + labs( x = "Year", y = "Catch (MT)")
```

Comparing the catches of Canadian Atlantic Cod to global catches of Atlantic Cod, we see a collapse starting 1992 for Canada, but global stocks are not depleted until around 2015.

## Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/worm2006.jpg)

This plot includes years 1950-2005 and the percentage of collapsed taxa.

##Plotting total taxa caught worldwide 1950-2006

Total taxa and corresponding information:

```{r}
global <- ram$taxonomy %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = "tsn") %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid") %>%
  left_join(ram$timeseries, by = "stockid") %>% 
  left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c("tsid" = "tsunique")) 
global
```
Total taxa for each year from 1950-2006:
```{r}
taxa_year <- global %>%
select(tsyear, scientificname.x, stockid, tsid, tsvalue) %>%
  filter(tsyear >= 1950, tsyear <= 2006) %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(n = n_distinct(tsid))
taxa_year
```

```{r}
ggplot(taxa_year, aes(x = tsyear, y = n)) + geom_point() + labs( x = "Year", y = "Number of taxa")
```

##Removing incomplete datasets
Filtering out NA's in data set including data from 1950-2006:
  
```{r}
taxa_clean <- global %>%
  filter(tsyear >= 1950, tsyear <= 2006) %>%
  select(tsyear, scientificname.x, stockid, tsvalue) %>%
  group_by(scientificname.x) %>%
  filter(!is.na(tsvalue)) 
taxa_clean
```

Stock IDs that have data for the full range (1950-2006):
```{r}
taxa_full <- taxa_clean %>%
  
  #number of years available per taxa
  group_by(tsyear, stockid) %>%
  summarise(total_value = sum(tsvalue)) %>%
  ungroup()  %>%
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  count() %>%
  
  #stockid with years from 1950-2006 = 94, 94 x 57 years = 5,130 total rows
  filter(n == 57) %>%

  
  #stockid with years from 1950-2006 joined to taxa_clean for tsvalue ()
  inner_join(taxa_clean) %>%
  filter(!is.na(n)) %>%
  group_by(tsyear, stockid) %>%
  summarise(total_value = sum(tsvalue)) 
  

taxa_full  
```
We found 90 taxa based on "stockid" that have data for the full 1950-2006 range.

## Collapsed fisheries

Table including `stockid`, `TC`, `year`, `collapsed`, and `cumulative`, 
where `collapsed` is a logical (True or False) for whether or not that fishery could
be considered collapsed in that year, and `cumulative` is the count of total years
the fishery has been collapsed at that point in time. A fishery is considered collapsed when total catch (TC) falls below 10% of its peak.

```{r}
taxa_peak <- taxa_full %>%
  
  #catch peak per taxa
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  summarise(peak = max(total_value)) %>%

  
  right_join(taxa_full) %>%
  select(stockid, tsyear, total_value, peak) %>%
  rename(year = tsyear, TC = total_value) %>%

  mutate(collapsevalue = peak - (peak * .1)) %>%

  #filter(year == 2006) %>%

  mutate(collapsed = TC < collapsevalue) %>%
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  mutate(cumulative = cumsum(collapsed))
 
taxa_peak
```
Cumulative years collapsed:
```{r}
taxa_peak %>%
  summarise(years_collapsed = max(cumulative)) 
```

##Plotting total catch

```{r}
taxa_peak %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = TC, fill = stockid)) + geom_area() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    labs( x = "Year", y = "Total Catch (MT)")
```
